How to build the Agdur Project
------------------------------

Agdur uses [psake](https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake) by [James Kovacs](http://jameskovacs.com/) to manage the build
process. psake is a Windows PowerShell based build tool and is included in the project (psake.ps1 and psake.psm1).

The project can be built either by executing release.bat or by executing psake.ps1.

Note: You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as an administrator in PowerShell

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Please refer to the [psake](https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake) project for further information.
